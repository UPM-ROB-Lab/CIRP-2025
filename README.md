# A Novel Generative AI Aided Smart Design Method Based on Imaginal Thinking Driven Retrieve-prompt
## Introduction
This work is based on our CIRP 2025 paper titled _A Novel Generative AI Aided Smart Design Method Based on Imaginal Thinking Driven Retrieve-prompt_. We propose a Generative AI retrieval-prompt method leveraging imaginal thinking to assist in smart design. This approach realizes the iterative optimization of automotive interior image. Below, we detail the implementation process of our method.
## Dependencies
### Requirements:
Our code has been tested with:
- Python (version 3.11)
- TensorFlow (version 2.16)
- CUDA (version 11.4)

Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed in your environment for smooth execution.
## Experimental flow
### 1. **Image Selection**
We selected 24 high-definition images of car interiors, which were divided into a **training set** and a **validation set** (15 images), and a **test set** (9 images). To minimize the impact of vehicle brand logos on interior design judgment, the logos were obscured using a Mosaic filter.

- The images in the **training** and **validation** sets are available in the directory:  
  [Training Set and Validation Set Images](./img/TrainingAndVerificationSet)
  
- The images in the **test** set are available in the directory:  
  [Test Set Images](./img/TestSet)

### 2. **Design a Subjective Questionnaire**
We designed a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire to collect subjective feedback on the interior designs. The content of the questionnaire is shown below.

### 3. **Stimulus Flow Presentation**
The experiment utilized the **Psychtoolbox** in MATLAB to present images sequentially. The experimenter's emotional responses were induced by observing the content of the displayed images, while EEG signals were simultaneously recorded. The related code can be found in the file [VisualPresentation.m](./code/VisualPresentation.m).

### 4. **Data Preprocessing and Training**

#### Data Preprocessing:
EEG data was collected from 34 channels, including: Fp1, Fp2, Af3, Af4, Fz, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC1, FC2, FC5, FC6, Cz, C3, C4, T7, T8, CP1, CP2, CP5, CP6, Pz, P3, P4, P7, P8, PO3, PO4, PO7, PO8, Oz, O1, O2.

- **Filtering**: We applied band-pass filtering to the raw data and extracted relevant frequency band features.
- **Resampling**: Data was downsampled to 200Hz.
- **Segmentation**: EEG data was segmented into 3-second windows, resulting in data dimensions of (210, 34, 600).

The related code can be found in the file [Preprocess.m](./code/Preprocess.m).
#### Training:
We used deep convolutional networks, including deep separable convolution layers, to process the EEG data. The related code can be found in the [EEGCNN.py](./code/EEGCNN.py). The detailed model structure is shown below.

  <img src="./img/CNN.jpg" width="90%" />
</div>

The model achieved an accuracy of **80.95%** on the emotion elicitation stage of the test set. Below, you can see the confusion matrix and t-SNE visualizations of the modelâ€™s classification performance.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./img/confusion.jpg" width="50%" />
</div>
<div align="center">
  <img src="./img/tSNE.jpg" width="50%" />
</div>

- **Neutral emotion** is represented in cyan blue.
- **Negative emotion** is represented in yellow.
- **Positive emotion** is represented in dark blue.

The confusion matrix shows that positive emotions were harder to classify compared to neutral and negative emotions, as seen in the t-SNE visualization.
### 5. **Design evaluation: Quantization formula calculation.**
We propose the following quantization formula for design evaluation:
$$
Score=\sum_{i=1}^N{\left[ \left( \frac{\widetilde{M_i}}{\sum_{p=1}^N{M_p}} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\alpha _i-\alpha _{i,\min}}{\alpha _{i,\max}-\alpha _{i,\min}} \right) \right]}+\widetilde{C}
$$
This formula calculates the score by integrating the EEG data from both the emotion elicitation and judgment stages, as well as the Likert scale feedback. In order to make the evaluation results of the formula more objective, the weights of the above three are set as **0.6**, **0.2** and **0.2** respectively.
The scores of each stage (emotion elicitation and judgment) were normalized using a sliding window, as shown below.

  <img src="./img/sliding.jpg" width="60%" />
</div>
Test set image detailed score calculation is shown in the figure below. The image of the car interior corresponding to the test set is visible in the folder.

### 6. **Retrieve prompt generation**
The retrieve-prompt format is as follows:
``` 
< Customer need (Optimized region, Likert scale score); Functional requirement; Design evaluation (Scheme, EEG objective score) + Market trends >
```
- **Customer Need**: Identifies the area in the design needing improvement based on the lowest Likert scale score.
- **Functional Requirement**: Defines the criteria for image segmentation, based on common functional areas in automotive interiors.
- **Design Evaluation**: Uses the previously introduced quantization formula to score the design image results.
- **Market Trends**: Provides optimization suggestions based on current trends in automotive design.
### 7. Iterative optimization phase.
To generate optimized results, the following models were executed sequentially:
1. **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**: Used for image segmentation and region-of-interest extraction.
2. **Diffusion Model**: Applied for image generation, refining the design iteratively.
#### Installation and Usage

We utilized Generative AI models developed by other researchers. Detailed installation and usage instructions for each model can be found at the following links:

- ![Segment Anything Model - Installation and Usage](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)
- ![Diffusion Model - Installation and Usage](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
#### Iteration Process

In this phase, the automobile interior image was iterated three times, with each iteration focused on specific areas and objectives. The search prompts for each iteration were as follows:
1. **Iteration 1:**
``` 
< (The gearshift lever, 1); Common functional areas; (Scheme2, 0.0358) + (Ergonomics, Aesthetics, Automatic transmission) >
```
2. **Iteration 2:**
``` 
< (The centre console, 1); Common functional areas; (Scheme2, 0.1284) + (Intelligent interaction, Multifunction) >
```
3. **Iteration 3:**
``` 
< (The overall interior, 3); Common functional areas; (Scheme2, 0.4932) + (Comfort, Luxury, Coordination) >
```
#### Model Functions

- **Segment Anything Model (SAM):** Extracts customer need and functional requirement in the retrieve prompt.
- **Diffusion Model:** Extracts the constraint conditions in the retrieve prompt..
#### Results
Each iteration generates a series of images, which can be found in the output folder. For each image, we apply a quantitative scoring formula to assess its quality. The generated images, along with their corresponding scores, reflect the results of each iteration and the refinement process based on the retrieve prompts.
